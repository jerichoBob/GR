# GR
A place to keep misc General Relativity projects at NC State.

The only 2 projects so far are:

1. [spacetime templates](SpacetimeTemplate/) (portrait and landscape) when you feel the need to freehand draw some spacetime diagrams!
2. some playing around with Mathematica to pretty-print Christoffel Symbols [here](Mathematica/).
